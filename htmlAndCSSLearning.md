# How the web works

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator
http or https is the protocol, and the website - facebook.com is the domain name
whatever comes after the domain name is the resource

The users browser is the client which makes a request to the server
the request is via HTTP and the server response is via HTTP as well 
the response is in HTML and has links to CSS and JS as well
the domain name is converted to IP address of the server via a Domain Name Server

HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
HTTP is stateless, each request/response is independent
Cookies are used to store data on the client and used to maintain statefulness 
200 is a successful response code and 404 is a not found response code
HTTP can have different types of requests as well  (GET, POST, PUT)

Quick source viewer is a good extension to view the website source

HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
JS - Behavior and Interactivity
