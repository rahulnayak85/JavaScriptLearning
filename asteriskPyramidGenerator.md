The asterisk Pyramid generator is a simple JS project that demonstrates a few different concepts

## Use of Functions

The main function in the code is called pyramid(). This code generates the individual rows of the pyramid based on two function parameters. 

The function is called within a loop. An alternate way of doing this project would have been to use the for loop within the function. 

## Use of variables 

Variables are used in three different areas. First, for declaring flags and counts to determine whether the pyramid should be inverted or not and to decide the size of the pyramid. Then, variables are used in the for loop and also in the function. 

## Printing an array

To print the array, another for loop is used where each element of the array is added to a string while concatenating it with a new line to provide the right preesentation. The string is concatenated with itself on every iteration as well.
